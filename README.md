## Will Porter

I'm Will, I love puzzles and activities. I am a qualified accountant currently studying at Makers Academy and am looking to utilise the things I am best to have a more engaging career. I would love to work in an engaging organisation with interesting people, solving problems and learning every day.


## Skills

- I am an excellent listener and pick up information and emotion from others naturally.

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- Throughout school and university I developed a proficiency at learning quickly but still in a holistic way.
- Through professional exams in my role as an auditor, I solidified this, learning and applying difficult subject matter in exams and in my job.
- I enjoy acting on feedback, either from others or through my own internal evaluation. Through reflecting on this feedback while removed from the situation I feel that I am able to improve as a developer and as a person.
