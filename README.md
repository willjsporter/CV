## Will Porter

Hi, I'm Will, I love puzzles and activities. Given that we spend a third of our time working (and one of the other thirds sleeping) it is super important to me to love my job. As such, I am looking for an exciting junior developer role to challenge me and to develop my skills in. 


## Skills

#### Communication and teamwork

- I am an excellent listener and pick up information and emotion from others naturally.
- My previous job as an auditor was extrememly client-facing. As such, I developed my communication skills by working with people in a wide range of different companies, at all levels.
- I have found pair programming a great way of developing these skills. Sharing ideas equitably has its challenges but this has taught me the value of a different perspective. I would look to find a role with a chance for regular collaboration with others.

#### Quick learner

- During school and university I developed a proficiency at learning quickly while still in a holistic way.
- Through professional exams in my role as an auditor, I solidified this. I learnt and applied challenging subject matter in exams and in my job.
- I spend a lot of time considering difficult problems I've encountered, whether coding, other puzzles or social dynamics and interactions. I find this allows me to really solidify my understanding of difficult subject matter and complex interpersonal issues.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (July 2017-October 2017)

- The main thing I have found is that I really enjoy coding - it is stimulating, challenging and rewarding.
- I really enjoy working in pairs and adapt to other working styles but also enjoy working alone if required.
- I worked hard to develop skills and behaviours rather than simply memorising syntax
- OOP, TDD, MVC, Databases (SQL and Mongo)
- Ruby, JavaScript, Rails, Node.js
- Rspec, Jasmine, Mocha
